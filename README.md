# 911-Calls-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I cleaned and prepared the data, which involved removing null values to get it ready for the analysis process. And I extracted year, date, month, day of week, hour from timestamp to do data visualization using seaborn &amp; search for various trends in occurrence of 911 calls for various reasons from various towns in USA. Time series analysis year wise, month wise,  day wise, &amp; hours has been done. Python libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy were used to develop this EDA project.
