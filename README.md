# 911-Calls-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

I cleaned and prepared the data, which involved removing null values to get it ready for the analysis process. And I extracted year, date, month, day of week, hour from timestamp to do data visualization using seaborn & search for various trends in occurrence of 911 calls for various reasons from various towns in USA. 

Time series analysis by year wise, month wise,  day wise, & hours wise has been done. 
Python libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy were used to develop this EDA project.
